"""Unit tests for the analysis pipeline's crash-localisation instrumentation.

A native-level process death — a segfault or abort inside onnxruntime, LibRaw
or OpenCV — never unwinds to an ``except`` block, so ``log_exception`` never
runs and the in-memory ``stage_ctx`` is lost. That is precisely the crash class
we cannot currently diagnose: the analysis log ends at ``analysis_start`` and
the next event never arrives, which narrows the fault only to "somewhere
between opening the database and finishing the first decode batch" — a window
that contains ONNX session construction, GPU provider initialisation, and RAW
decoding.

These tests pin the two additions that close that gap:

1. Each once-per-run setup stage is *persisted* as it is entered, so the last
   record in the log names the stage the process died in.
2. ``analysis_start`` records the GPU request and ``models_loaded`` records
   what ONNX Runtime actually granted, so a silent GPU->CPU fallback is
   visible in a crash report.

They also pin the invariant that all of this is observability only: it must
never change what a run does, and must never fail a run.
